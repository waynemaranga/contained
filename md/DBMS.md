## What is a DBMS?

[1.][1] A simple database management system (DBMS) definition is middleware that allows programmers, database administrators (DBAs), software application, and end users to store, organize, access, query, and manipulate data in a database.
DBMSs are important because they provide efficient and reliable mechanisms for organizing, managing, and using vast amounts of data while also ensuring data integrity and providing other data management benefits.

[2.][2] Database Management Systems (DBMS) are software systems used to store, retrieve, and run queries on data. A DBMS serves as an interface between an end-user and a database, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete data in the database. DBMS manage the data, the database engine, and the database schema, allowing for data to be manipulated or extracted by users and other programs. This helps provide data security, data integrity, concurrency, and uniform data administration procedures. DBMS optimizes the organization of data by following a database schema design technique called normalization, which splits a large table into smaller tables when any of its attributes have redundancy in values. DBMS offer many benefits over traditional file systems, including flexibility and a more complex backup system. Database management systems can be classified based on a variety of criteria such as the data model, the database distribution, or user numbers. The most widely used types of DBMS software are relational, distributed, hierarchical, object-oriented, and network.

[3.][3] A database management system (DBMS) describes a collection of multiple software services that work together to store, compute, maintain, structure, and deliver the data as part of a product. This platform also provides metadata, a system of data labeling, so that engineers and users can understand and map what entities and properties are available and their relationships. While database administration products offer structured ways to organize, manage, and protect data, enforce data integrity, and facilitate data sharing and collaboration, they vary based on the underlying technologies and their offerings. For example, a relational database system (RDBMS), like Microsoft SQL Server, ensures reliable database transactions through ACID properties. On the other hand, a non-relational database system (NRDBMS or No-SQL DBMS), like MongoDB, scales data better and handles rapid data changes and scales better through BASE properties.
